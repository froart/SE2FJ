\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Description of the system}

The project that we are implementing is called Car-Sharing Service, with the help of
which users can reserve the electrical car and use it. The service is based on web
application with one target of people: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item users \\
\end{itemize}
Users must provide information about themselves, including their credentials and
payment information in order to register an account in this system, and access it.
Users can locate available electrical cars nearby or in the certain area. Also users can
see current battery fulness of each car. \\
After selecting the car, user can reserve it for up to one hour. When a user reaches the
reserved car, system allows the user to unlock the car. As soon as the engine ignites,
users can see current charges through the screen in the car. \\
User can leave the car for a short period of time without missing the car reservation.
When the user tells the system that he doesn’t need the car no more, it stops charging
the user. At this point the car can’t be controlled by the user no more and it be
becomes available for users again. \\
System, in order to restrain the behaviour of users, and to encourage virtuous
behaviours of users, will carry out some reward and punishment features.

\subsubsection{Actual system}

Sometime ago the car sharing companies used the system according to which the the
car identifies users only by their membership cards. Such system forces users to have
membership cards, that must be ordered and collected. \\
The system we suggest reduces the necessity of having such cards, but lets the users to
use the car via web application, where only registration is needed. \\
During registration user provides all the necessary information, including payment
credentials.

\subsection{Goals}

To specify the task goals were defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item {[G1]} Registered users(users) can access the system.
	\item {[G2]} Users can locate all unoccupied electric cars parked nearby or within a specific area.
	\item {[G3]} Users can see the information about battery fulness of each unoccupied electrical car.
	\item {[G4]} Users can reserve available electric car.
	\item {[G5]} Users can access the reserved car.
	\item {[G6]} Users can park the car for later usage without missing the "occupied" status.
	\item {[G7]} Users are notified about current driving charges.
	\item {[G8]} Users are encouraged to use the service properly.
	\item {[G8.1]} Users have a 10\% discount when he picks at least 2 more passenger onto the car.
	\item {[G8.2]} Users have a 20\% discount on the ride if he left the car with no more than 50\% battery empty.
	\item \sout{[G8.3] Users have a 30\% discount on the ride if he left the car on the special parking area with the power grid station and plugged car to it.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Domain assumptions}

We suppose that these properties hold in the analysed world:
\begin{itemize}
	\item All electric cars have GPS navigators.
	\item GPS navigators state the right positions of users and cars 
	\item Car has a set of sensors to define the current state for the car (cameras, engine
	state sensors, battery fulness sensors, \sout{battery charge sensors} 
	\item Car has an inner operating system, that acquire and process information from sensors(cameras, engine
	state sensors, battery fulness sensors, \sout{battery charge sensors}), starts/kills engine, locks/unlocks doors, displays
	information on the screen.
	\item Users drive accurately, without car damage.
	\item \sout{Special charging parking areas are defined in advance}
	\item CarSharing Company has workers that charges cars that are left uncharged and far from
	charging station and park them in a convenient place \\
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Application domain}

CarSharing System can be applied in the area where
\begin{itemize}
	\item Air pollution is serious.
	\item Public transportation infrastructures are imperfect.
\end{itemize}
The applicable group, people who:
\begin{itemize}
	\item are environmentalists,
	\item use car occasionally,
	\item who don't have own cars.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Glossary}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Registered user: He/She is a client of car-sharing service who sends requests to the 
	system. He/She is able to register and access the system, reserve and use reserved
	cars. While registering he/she should provide the following information:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Name and Surname
		\item Payment credentials
		\item Phone number
		\item Username
		\item Password
		\item In order to search and reserve the car, user must provide his/her position or
	coordinates of specific area. Position can be acquire by the system
	automatically via GPS.
	\end{itemize}
	\item User: the same as "Registered user"
	\item Passengers: User is allowed to pick up more people to join the trip. If the system detects the user took at least two other passengers onto the car(e.g. via camera face capture system), the system applies a discount of 10\% on the last ride.
	\item Electric car: Car, that is provided by the CarSharing Company. Uses electrical power to ride.
	\item Available car: Electric Car, that is currently available, thus can be reserved by any registered user.
	\item Reserved car: Electric Car, that is reserved for using by the user. Reservation status lasts for 1 hour and afterwards car becomes available again and user is charged with 1 Euro, unless he occupies the car(see further)
	\item Occupied car: Car, that is currently occupied by some registered user. Car from the moment user starts the engine to the time he ends the trip.
	\item Unoccupied car: the same as "Available car"
	\item Trip: The period from the moment when user starts the engine to use the car until the end of the trip.
	\item Specific area: are that is specified by the user within which the system searches for unoccupied cars. This area is 1km\^2.
	\item \sout{Special parking areas: These are the areas where car can be parked and plugged into the power grid station for recharging.}
	\item Position/Location: GPS coordinates
	\item System: Platform(Software) that is being implemented.
	\item Background System: the same as the "System", to distinguish the implemented System from the one specified in the "Car’s inner OS" paragraph.
	\item Car’s inner OS: It is the car’s embedded operating system that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item responds to requests from background system
		\item can interact with a screen that notifies the user about the current charges
		\item acquires information from sensors of the car
		\item provides information to background system
	\end{itemize}
	\item "Unlock"/"Lock" button: button in the web application that can unlock the door of car. Can be used only if the system states that the user is nearby the reserved car. It is also physically implemented inside the car. 
	\item "Start/kill Engine" button: This button can ignite or kill the engine. Implemented
	physically inside the car.
	\item "End the Trip" button: Button in the web application that must be pressed to state that the user has finishes the trip. After that System stops charging the user.
	\item \sout{Power grid station: place, where user is able to recharge the car.}
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Constrains}
\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
The System must:
\begin{itemize}
	\item keep the payment information of users confidentially;
	\item ask users permission to use their GPS coordinates.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
User’s devices: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3G/4G connection
	\item GPS
	\item Space for app package
\end{itemize}
Car’s inner OS: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Internet connection with background system
	\item Screen (show current charges)
	\item GPS
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parallel operation}
The server supports parallel operations from different users.

\section{Scenarios identifying}

Here some possible scenarios of usage of application. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Scenario 1} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Melissa needs to get to the job, which is on the other side of Milano. But due to the
protests on Friday, metro is closed. Melissa new about it in advance, so she decided to
use the Car-Sharing system. She registered and reserved the nearest electric car in the
morning and reached the job. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Scenario 2} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Jack is the tourist and he decides to watch all the main places of Milano. He decides
to use the Car-Sharing system. He finishes the registration via smartphone, reserves
the nearest car and drives it to the different destinations. When he reaches the
destination he leaves the car suspended and locked to watch the attractions. When he
returns he unlocks the car and drive it to another places. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Scenario 3} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Nicola lives far from the city and needs to get his son from school, but his car is
broken. He already has an account in the Car-Sharing system and reserves the electric
car on the specific area that is close to the train station. He reaches this station by train
and drives to the son’s school be the reserved car. When he picks his son he drives
back home and leaves it nearby his house with the 85\% battery empty. Nicola is
charged 30\% more. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Scenario 4} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Kate decides to take a ride home by the electric car after meeting her friend in the
cafe. She reserved the car nearby and continued to talk to her friend. Suddenly she
realizes that the time of reservation is going to expire. She misses the reservation time
and is charged by 1 Euro. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Scenario 5} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Luci’s car is broken. In the morning she always drive her children Peggy and Steve to
the school and then she drives to her job. She reserved the electric car not far from her
house with 100\% battery fulness. When family gets to the car it captures that there are
3 people in the car and system starts to charge Luci 10\% less. After she drove Peggy
and Steve to the school, system stops the discount charging. After Luci drove to her
job, the battery was more than 50\% full. The total price for the ride is the sum of the
discount time charging, when she was driving with her kids and the time charging
without discount, when she was driving alone. Plus she gets 10\% discount on the total
price, because car is left with more than 50\% full battery. \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\sout{\textbf {Scenario 6}} \\
\vspace{0.5cm}
\sout{Caroline has reserved the car electric and want to go to the bank. Luckily bank is
situated near the special parking area. When she gets there, she parks on that area and
plug the car to the power station. Caroline gets 30\% discount on the ride.}
