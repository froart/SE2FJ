\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Description of the system} \\

The project that we are implementing is called Car-Sharing Service, with the help of
which users can reserve the electrical car and use it. The service is based on web
application with one target of people: \\
\begin{itemize}
	\item users \\
\end{itemize}
Users must provide information about themselves, including their credentials and
payment information in order to register an account in this system, and access it.
Users can locate available electrical cars nearby or in the certain area. Also users can
see current battery fulness of each car. \\
After selecting the car, user can reserve it for up to one hour. When a user reaches the
reserved car, system allows the user to unlock the car. As soon as the engine ignites,
users can see current charges through the screen in the car. \\
User can leave the car for a short period of time without missing the car reservation.
When the user tells the system that he doesn’t need the car no more, it stops charging
the user. At this point the car can’t be controlled by the user no more and it be
becomes available for users again. \\
System, in order to restrain the behaviour of users, and to encourage virtuous
behaviours of users, will carry out some reward and punishment features.

\subsubsection{Actual system}

Sometime ago the car sharing companies used the system according to which the the
car identifies users only by their membership cards. Such system forces users to have
membership cards, that must be ordered and collected. \\
The system we suggest reduces the necessity of having such cards, but lets the users to
use the car via web application, where only registration is needed. \\
During registration user provides all the necessary information, including payment
credentials.
